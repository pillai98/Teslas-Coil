    <p>
      The Tesla Coil was invented in 1891 by Nikola Tesla. It was designed to produce high-voltage,
      low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity. Tesla used it for various experiments,
      including wireless transmission of electrical energy.

    <h3>Basic Principles</h3>
    <p>
      A Tesla coil uses a primary coil and a secondary coil with capacitors to create a resonant
      transformer circuit. When electricity flows into the primary coil, it creates a magnetic field
      that induces a much higher voltage in the secondary coil.
